# WILD7400_growthchoice
Class project coding a simple model relating to aspects of the landscape of fear framework in Ecology. The model will answer the question: does an ecosystem that contains only the highest quality foods always support a large and stable population for a species that relies on this resource?

Key model attributes:
1. Size is related to an individual's willingness to search for high quality food: larger individuals are more likely to search for better quality food whereas smaller individuals may "make do" with lower quality food
2. Food quality is realated to accessibility of that food resource: higher quality food is harder to find and will take longer to find/process compared to lower quality food sources

Other things that will need to be defined: 
1. Growth
2. Herbivore species reproduction
3. Food resource replication
4. Searching behavior
